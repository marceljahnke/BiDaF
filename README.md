# BiDaF Baseline

This project is part of the AI laboratory of the Leibniz university Hanover (WiSe 19/20).
The task is to use the **BiDaF** model with four different datasets, namely:

- MS MARCO Passage Retrieval
- FiQA
- InsuranceQA
- WikiPassageQA

The resulting data wil be used as a baseline in further studies. In addition, it is desirable that the model can easily be extended by further data sets.
