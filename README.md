# BiDaF Baseline

This project is part of the AI laboratory of the Leibniz university Hanover (WiSe 19/20).

## Task
Given a question and a set of passages, rank them by relevance to the
question using the **BiDaF** model, for the following data sets:

- MS MARCO Passage Retrieval
- FiQA
- InsuranceQA
- WikiPassageQA

The resulting data wil be used as a baseline in further studies. In addition, it is desirable that the model can easily be extended by further data sets.

## Requirements
...

## Training
...

## Prediction
...

## Objectives

- Implement the BiDAF model
- Modify the output layer to produce a score of a passage w.r.t. a query
- Implement ranking metrics (MRR, MAP)
- Good documentation of the code
- (possibility to extend the project with other datasets)
